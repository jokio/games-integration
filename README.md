Basic
-----
If you want to give your users ability to play games & have fun, it's very simple, just follow the link:
```

```
Just replace values:
* [GAME_NAME] - name of the game, which you want to integrate on your site (please see reserved game key-s below)
* [CHANNEL] - there is possibiliy to group players using channels, empty channel means it is public
* [EXIT_URL] - when player press exit button, where to redirect
